# Philadelphia READS Web App [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/hack4impact-uiuc/philareads.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/hack4impact-uiuc/philareads)

We partnered with the non-profit Philadelphia READS to help them create a tablet-friendly web application that would serve as a supplement to one of their core reading programs.

## About Philadelphia READS
Philadelphia READS aims to provide access to books and community programs to foster a love of reading and increase literacy in Philadelphia. They do this through four core literacy programs: Power Partners, Reading Olympics, the Jacoby Book Bank and Summer READS. Through these programs, they serve approximately 27,800 children and 600 educators annually.

## The Problem
Philadelphia READS provides out-of-school programs to increase literacy rates among grade-school students. One of these programs is the yearly Reading Olympics. Teams of students read books from a specified book list and prepare to answer questions about the books. One drawback is that these programs are all tied to in-person interactions and Philadelphia READS does not have resources for students while they are at home or on the go.

## Our Solution
We worked with Philadelphia READs and their professionals to develop a tablet-friendly web application that allows students to prepare for the Reading Olympics, and provides helpful information for parents on how to be involved in their children's learning.
