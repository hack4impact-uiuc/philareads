# API Docs
This document contains information about how data is structured in the backend and how the frontend/backend communicate to change that data
## Conventions
This API follows the [H4I REST API Spec](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/wiki/wiki/Our-REST-API-Specification)

Routes and data schemas can be found on [Swaggerhub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/philareads/Backend/1.0.0-oas3#/)

Each routes response from swaggerhub lies in the result object of the json response outlined in the [H4I REST API Spec](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/wiki/wiki/Our-REST-API-Specification)
